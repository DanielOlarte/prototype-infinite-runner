## Overview

It’s a 2D side-scroller infinite runner prototype developed by me in Unity3D for PC and Android. The main goal of the player it’s go through the level and collect all the possible objects using his ability of jump and double jump, and the walls as a way to gain speed and height. The movement in the X-axis is constant because it was originally developed for mobile devices. Features different obstacles and objects that make him lose or go backwards.

The main intention with this prototype was understand more clearly how collisions and movements with different components of Unity works in PC and Android.

## Responsibilities

* Implementation of the basic functionality such as movement, jump and double jump. Collection of objects and state of the character.
* Collision system for collectible objects and obstacles that make lose the player.
* Basic level design with different types of obstacles based on the response to the player.
